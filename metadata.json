  "description": "Provides color filters to help color blind users distinguish colors and developers understand how they perceive uncorrected colors.\n\nThe menu offers correction filters as well as simulation filters that demonstrate how color blind individuals perceive colors. Included are filters for protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia, with adjustable strength and using the same algorithm as on Android phones. Three variations on the algorithm are available: the exact filter from Android Open Source Project (AOSP), an improved HPE filter with reduced color artifacts, and a modified filter with more sophisticated tritanomaly processing. Additionally, filters for desaturation, channel mix, and lightness and color inversions are provided.\n\nPrimary mouse button click on the panel button toggles active filter, secondary click opens configuration menu, and scroll switches filters.",
