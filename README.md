All development related to the "Colorblind Filters Advanced" plugin takes place
[on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/amyp/gnome-colorblind-filters). The
developer prefers that you open issues there. The code here is not up to date,
so you should not create PRs against it. Go to Codeberg for the current code.

The developer keeps this repo around (and not archived) for the purpose of
upstreaming code to G-dH's "Colorblind Filters" extension.
