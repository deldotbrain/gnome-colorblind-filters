# Colorblind Filters
A GNOME Shell extension for main panel that offers full-screen color filters that should help color-blind users and developers.

This version was forked from [the original on
GitHub](https://github.com/G-dH/gnome-colorblind-filters) to replace its
daltonization algorithm with the one used by Android devices, which I find more
helpful.

Supports GNOME Shell 45 - 48

## Contribution
Unless your contribution is specific to the daltonization algorithm, please
consider making your contribution to the original extension [on
GitHub](https://github.com/G-dH/gnome-colorblind-filters) so that its users can
benefit from it. Of course, I'll accept contributions here, as well.

Also, feel free to [buy the original author a
coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/georgdh) if you find this extension useful. He
did most of the work.
